### Another pomodoro app, like never before.

Be more productive to be less busy. A subtile app that will tell you when to take a break to be more productive. Configure your time, and it will notificate you when it's time to take a break.

### Featuring

- Mac app done entirely programmatically.
- Different windows and view controllers.
- Launch app at login.
- Changing menu icon to display a subtile timer.
- Amazing break view to relax and stand up for a moment.

The app is not going to be in the store because it's a complete learning app. Feel free to download the Xcode project and PR if you think something needs to be improved :).

In case you want to download it anyway, you can go to the following link: [Prodam](http://ramongilabert.com/prodam) and authorize the app, don't worry, it's safe! :)
